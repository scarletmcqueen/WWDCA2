Welcome to my Working with Data and Code Assignment! This has been a long-time in the making, and I can't wait for you to 
listen to my mini EP of 3 songs! Here's how to navigate my project:

1. Attached is a word document file with 3 links, these are my three songs, and they'll be labeled accordingly.
2. Please click the links (or copy paste the link into your browser) to be directed to my project files.
3. They are view-only, so don't worry about any misclicks, you wont make any changes.
4. Once the link has loaded, the project screen may be partially blank. This is normal. Press the green 'Run' button to load the code.
5. Now, you should see my coded song on the screen. To play, press the triangular play button at the top slightly to the right. It's green too!
6. To go back and listen from the start, press the button to the left of the play button

   BONUS:
   - if you'd like to hear any of my tracks isolated, particularly in the third song as I made the tracks myself as opposed to using the given sound library,
   please press the S (solo) or M (mute) to adjust the tracks to your liking!

Please note, I have written comments throughout my song projects, so scroll through the code to see them!

Thank you,
